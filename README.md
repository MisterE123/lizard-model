# lizard-model
A cute voxelized lizard model for a minetest mob, with 2 stand animations, a walk anim, and a die anim

This can be used for any mob for minetest, just put the image in the textures folder, 
and the .b3d file in the models folder. You will have to play around with the size 
and the selection box from within the code.
